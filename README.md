# Dimensionality Estimation and Reduction

MLE - Maximum Likelihood Estimation
Dimensionality Estimation

Algorithm in order to check the code of the MLE from Levina paper
The code was tested in two popular artificial datasets, Swiss Roll and Scurve
The result dimensionanality was the expected dimension of 2

LLE -Locally Linear Embedding 
Algorithm for dimensionality reduction based in local linear recontruction
